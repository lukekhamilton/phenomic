This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is different on the client or server:\n (client) .4\">Usage&#x3C;/a>&#x3C;/nav>&#x3C;noscript data-reacti\n (server) .4\">Usage&#x3C;/a>&#x3C;/nav>&#x3C;div data-reactid=\".p1 phenomic.browser.js:1134:8\n</code></pre>\n<p>The message is pretty clear. You have to examine your code and check carefully\nwhat can be rendered differently. Feel free to ask for help on <a href=\"https://gitter.im/MoOx/phenomic\">gitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are some common cases for this warning:</p>\n<h3 id=\"date-and-time\"><a href=\"#date-and-time\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Date and time</h3>\n<p>Due to the timezone differences between the build server and your visitors, generated\ndate and time can be different. To fix this, ensure that the timezone is\ncorrectly set.</p>\n<p>Example with <code>moment.js</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-diff\"><span class=\"hljs-deletion\">-- moment(data).format(\"DD MMM YYYY\")</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-addition\">++ moment(date).utc().format(\"DD MMM YYYY\")</span></code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"navigation-links-with-active-class\"><a href=\"#navigation-links-with-active-class\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Navigation links with active class</h3>\n<p>With Phenomic, a user can request a page with or without the trailing <code>index.html</code>.\nIf you are using <code>react-router</code> <code>&#x3C;Link /></code> component with the <code>activeClassName</code> property,\nReact will warn with the above message. We provided a <code>&#x3C;LinkWrapper /></code> component to\ncover this case.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-diff\"><span class=\"hljs-deletion\">-- import { Link } from \"react-router\"</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-addition\">++ import { Link } from \"phenomic/lib/Link\"</span></code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-debug-this-checksum-issue\"><a href=\"#how-to-debug-this-checksum-issue\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>How to debug this checksum issue?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the rendered html (viewsource is your friend)</li>\n<li>In your developer tools, copy the HTML from the <code>&#x3C;html</code> node\n(something like right click > \"Copy Outer HTML\" should exist)</li>\n<li>Beautify both results with the same tool\n(eg: <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautifier\">atom-beautifier</a>)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make a diff (if you are a GUI guy, use\n<a href=\"https://www.diffchecker.com/\">diffchecker</a>).\nNotes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remove the beginning of each <code>data-reactid</code> to avoid a huge diff</li>\n<li>ignore the first huge <code>&#x3C;style></code> tag</li>\n<li>ignore diff related to the style of self-closing tag (html or xhtml) if\nyou have some</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should find the source of the error pretty quickly this way.</p>\n","__filename":"docs/faq/react.md","__url":"/docs/faq/react/","__resourceUrl":"/docs/faq/react/index.html","__dataUrl":"/docs/faq/react/index.html.7229cd719c461207ed5e9d9b6409dd38.json"}

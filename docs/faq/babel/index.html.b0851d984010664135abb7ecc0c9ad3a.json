Just a simple information.</em></p>\n<p>When babel compiles some code it tries to offer readable output, but when files\nget large (>100KB), babel considers (by default) that it's not useful to make\nthe output readable.\nIf you are annoyed by this message, or if you don't care about readability,\nyou can just use <code>compact: true</code>.\nOr <code>false</code> if you do.\nOnly the <code>\"auto\"</code> value (default value) will print this warning.\nSee <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/\">babel options</a>\nfor more information.</p>\n","__filename":"docs/faq/babel.md","__url":"/docs/faq/babel/","__resourceUrl":"/docs/faq/babel/index.html","__dataUrl":"/docs/faq/babel/index.html.b0851d984010664135abb7ecc0c9ad3a.json"}
